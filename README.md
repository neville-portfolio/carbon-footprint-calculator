## 📌 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of my MSc in Computer Science with Data Analytics. It addresses the growing need for individual environmental accountability by offering a user-friendly and inclusive carbon footprint calculator.

It not only estimates users’ carbon output using reliable UK emissions factors, but also helps track progress over time and educates users on reduction strategies.
